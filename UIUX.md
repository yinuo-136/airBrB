1. For the hosted listing page, instead of using the button that describes the functionalities of 'edit', 'delete', 'publish', 'unpublish', and 'view booking status', I choose to use icon buttons to make the listings less crowded. Also, buttons accurately represent the operation it is meant to have. E.g a bin for deleting, a pen for editing, a book page for viewing booking status, and a cloud upload icon for publishing online.

2. The color I used for the entire app does not contain any highly contrasting colors, the two main colors for the app I made were blue and light grey which will make users feel comfortable while viewing pages.

3. Though the requirement does not mention, when a user changes to a new screen(e.g. from the dashboard to my listings screen), I added a button on the top left to allow the user to go back to the original page they came from.

4. For statuses of 'pending', 'declined', and 'accept' show on a lot of the screens. I used different colors which basically represent the meaning of the status. Red for declined, green for accepted, and yellow/orange for pending.

5. The font I made for describing important text elements is made bigger and bold to illustrate the importance of the information.

6. Some instructions are given if users are meant to check something that they can not in their current identity. For example, users that are not in login status will not be allowed to check the booking info for a specific listing. Therefore, there will be an instruction that basically tells user that they need to login to view booking information.
